\usage{
uncertain_tree(
  X,
  max_depth = 5,
  split_finder = find_rule2,
  nosplit_columns = NULL,
  row_id = NULL,
  chronological_errors = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{The data to use - currently only supports a matrix.}

\item{max_depth}{The maximal depth of the tree (though the tree might be shorter - this is an upper bound).}

\item{nosplit_columns}{Columns to ignore when splitting - but which are nonetheless propagated to
the terminal node.}

\item{row_id}{A subset of rows to use for growing the tree - if **NULL**, use all rows.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}

\item{chronological_oob}{Use only observations which came **after** the training set for errors?}
}
\value{
A fitted tree
}
\description{
Fit a random tree to your data.
